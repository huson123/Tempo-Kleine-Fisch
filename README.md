# Tempo-Kleine-Fisch
Digital version of the classic children’s board game Tempo, kleine Fische, developed entirely in Java using JavaFX

This project was created as the final assignment for the Java Programming course at Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences WS24 (Group: Boardgame Guru) 

## Overview
The game fully preserves the original board game mechanics:
- Color-based dice rolling
- Turn-based movement
- Fish escaping to the sea
- Ship catching fish
- Win / Lose / Tie conditions
The implementation follows the MVC (Model–View–Controller) architecture and Object-Oriented Programming principles.
